# What is an API?

"API" stands for "Application Programming Interface" which is a set of procedures that help software applications communicate with each other.

Most of the time APIs are aimed at developers who want to build an application that speaks to a piece of software. They are also a way for the creator of a tool to control how others are accessing what is in the tool.

In the early days of computing APIs helped different pieces of software on the same computer talk to each other but they have since evolved to support communication over networks, between different computers.

## Useful metaphors

You can think of an API as:

* the waiter who works between a person ordering food at a restaurant and the cook
  * Andrew Park wrote a great description of this metaphor here https://tray.io/blog/how-do-apis-work

## Types of APIs
For this workshop we are only addressing one category of APIs which are referred to as "RESTful". RESTful APIs use the REST (Representational State Transfer) architecture which is essentially a series of procedures that help software applications communicate with each other. The REST architecture takes advantage of existing protocols on the web to communicate between applications and generally moves data in the JSON format. It is light and flexible compared to other similar architectures and commonly used for Open APIs on the web.
